A time management app to work more effectively. 

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

The original technique has six steps:

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).[1]
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5–10 minutes).[5]
5. If you have finished fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
6. After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.

A goal of the technique is to reduce the effect of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow.
